We use a variety of different manufacturers who sometimes use different color schemes (typically brown or black) for products. Depending on availability of the product, the color may be different from the one that is pictured in the listing.

Often a part will be a different color if the part was not in stock and was automatically upgraded to a better grade part that was in stock. For example, an out of stock OE Type CV Axle might be substituted with a Heavy Duty CV Axle at no additional cost to the customer.

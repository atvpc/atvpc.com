A **C**onstant **V**elocity joint (CV Joint) is one of the types of joints used on a vehicle's axle. The other type, called an U-Joint is different from a CV Joint, however most u-joint axles also have one CV joint (however a few axles use only u-joints). A CV joint is made up of the housing, race, cage, and balls.

An unique tracking number is generated by our shipping carriers to track your package's status from the warehouse to your shipping address. It is generated after the carrier picks the package up from our warehouse. If you provided an email address, this tracking number will automatically be emailed to you.

To track your package, simply type the tracking number into <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, which will automatically determine the carrier and offer to track your package. You can also determine the carrier based on the tracking number format and visit their respective package tracking page. For convenience, the direct links those pages are listed below as well as a description of each carrier's tracking number format:

* [UPS](http://www.ups.com/tracking/tracking.html) - 18 characters long starting with "1Z" followed by a 16 digit number
* [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/") - 15 digit number
* [USPS](https://www.usps.com/shipping/trackandconfirm.htm) - 22 characters long

*If you have not received the tracking number after the package has shipped, feel free to [contact us](?contact).*

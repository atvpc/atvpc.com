(10) VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE
------------------------------------
ATV PC may disclose any information we have about a user (including actual 
identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection 
with any investigation or complaint regarding that user's use of the site, 
or to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be 
causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or 
unintentionally) ATV PC’s rights or property, or the rights or property 
of visitors to or users of the site, including ATV PC's customers. ATV PC 
further reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that 
ATV PC deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation,

such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and 
organizations for fraud protection purposes.

User acknowledge and agrees that ATV PC may preserve any transmittal or 
communication by User with ATV PC through the site or any service offered

so by law or if ATV PC determines that such preservation or disclosure is 
reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these 
Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims for the violation of the rights of 
others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of ATV PC, 
its employees, users of or visitors to the site, and the public.

access to the site if we determine that User have violated these Terms of 
Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with User's 
use of the site. User also agrees that any violation of these Terms of Use 
will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause 
irreparable harm to ATV PC, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, 
and you consent to ATV PC obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that 
ATV PC deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies 
are in addition to any other remedies ATV PC may have at law or in equity.

You agree that ATV PC may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, 
terminate your access to the site, for cause, which includes (but is not

discontinuance or material modification of the site or any service offered 
on or through the site, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.

If ATV PC does take any legal action against User as a result of violation 
of these Terms of Use, ATV PC will be entitled to recover from User, and 
User agrees to pay, all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of such 
action, in addition to any other relief granted to ATV PC. User agrees

termination of User's access to the site as a result of any violation of

These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between ATV PC and 
User regarding the subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement, whether 
oral or written, between ATV PC and User dealing with the subject matter

available, including but not limited to, direct, consequential and 
punitive damages and injunctive relief. ATV PC’s remedies are cumulative 
and not exclusive. Failure of ATV PC to exercise any remedy or enforce 
any portion of this Agreement at any time shall not operate as a waiver

any time thereafter. User agrees that, regardless of any statute or law 
to the contrary, any claim or action arising out of or regarding this 
Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of 
action arose or be forever barred. ATV PC makes no representation that the 
content of the site is appropriate or available for use in all locations.

local laws. Any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall be governed 
by the laws of the State of Maryland, U.S.A, notwithstanding any conflicts 
of law principles. Any action relating to this Agreement must be filed 
and maintained in a state or federal court located in Howard County,

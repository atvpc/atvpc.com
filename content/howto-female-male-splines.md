A U-Joint axle has one CV joint on the outboard and a universal joint and yoke assembly on the inboard. The u-joint yoke may have male or female type splines depending on the axle. Male splines have a rod that goes into the differential. Female splines have an opening in which a rod from the differential goes into. This illustration compares the two.

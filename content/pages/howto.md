    <dt>Choosing the correct side: right or left?</dt>
    <dd>
		<p>To choose the correct side for an axle you should pick the side as you are sitting on the vehicle. For instance, if you are sitting on the vehicle and the left side axle needs to be replaced, you should order a left side, not a right. Never choose a side based on looking at the ATV from the front.</p>

    <dt>Finding the VIN</dt>
    <dd>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is an unique 17 digit number made out of letters and numbers that contains a lot of information about that vehicle such as where and when it was made.</p>
					<p>Vehicles made at the end of the year are often labeled as being manufactured in the upcoming year even though the two years use different parts. Split year vehicles also use different parts but are made in the same year. In this case you will need to know the month of the manufacture date. Both these problems are typically not apparent, so a VIN can confirm the exact date of manufacture.</p>
					<p>By law, all ATVs and UTVs must be issued a VIN. Every vehicle made or sold in the US since 1971 has one. Its location is different between each OEM, but can always be found somewhere permanent. Typically, it is stamped on the frame or a metal plate near the frame.</p>
				    <p>If you cannot find the VIN, try searching online for the location of the VIN on your particular vehicle or contact the manufacturer and ask them for it's location.
					<p>If you do contact the manufacturer, it's best to ask them to decode it for you. We have access to general tools to decode VINs but they are not as sophisticated and detailed as the manufacturer's decoder</p>

	<dt>What affects the shipping fee?</dt>
    <dd>
		<p>The shipping fee is determined by the carrier (UPS, FedEx, USPS) and is dependant on the shipping address and weight of the package. Unfortunately, we do not control the fee charged by the shipping carriers.</p>
		<p>While we do carry some small parts, most of the parts such as complete CV axles are awkwardly shaped and therefore do not fit into flat rate packaging. Many of the parts weigh much more than an usual package. For instance, CV axles are almost entirely made out of steel and can weigh more than 10 pounds.</p>
		<p>Shipping fees also tend to double when special services such as overnight delivery are needed. It is not unusual for a package to have shipping fees over $100 when some of these services are requested.</p>

	<dt>Driveshafts</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>A driveshaft can refer to one of a few different parts. Industry terms are different from manufacturer to manufacturer. For this reason, it is best to avoid using the term "driveshaft" to describe any vehicle part. Instead, use more specific terms that tend not to be confused such as "complete CV axle" or "propshaft".</p>

	<dt>Propshafts</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Propshafts are located between the front and rear differentials. Depending on the vehicle, it may have one or two propshafts. 2x4 vehicles will only have one propshaft, while 4x4 vehicles will have two.</p>

    <dt>What is your return policy?</dt>
    <dd>
		Our returns policy can be found with our easy to understand warranty policy on the <a href="./?p=policies#warranty">store policies</a> page.
    </dd>
    
	<dt>The item I recieved is a different color than the picture</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>We use a variety of different manufacturers who sometimes use different color schemes (typically brown or black) for products. Depending on availability of the product, the color may be different from the one that is pictured in the listing.</p>
		<p>Often a part will be a different color if the part was not in stock and was automatically upgraded to a better grade part that was in stock. For example, an out of stock OE Type CV Axle might be substituted with a Heavy Duty CV Axle at no additional cost to the customer.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>The part I ordered does not fit on my vehicle</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>We strive to correctly ship every order. Unfortunately, rare circumstances do arise such as incorrectly shipped parts. In the event this occurs, make sure you have access to the following information before <a href="./p=contact">contacting us</a>:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Sales Number</strong> - the sales number will allow us to quickly pull up your order from our computer system. You can find it at the top right of your sales receipt
			<li><strong>Year, Make, Model</strong> - The fitment information will allow us to confirm what is the correct part for your vehicle. The model should include the engine size. For instance, "Polaris Sportsman 500" might refer to 3 different vehicles which take different parts: "Polaris Sportsman 500", "Polaris Sportsman 500 H.O.", and "Polaris Sportsman 500 X2".
			<li><strong>Packaging</strong> - Most packaging we use have a part number on one of the ends that can be compared to the actual part ordered. 
			<li><strong>VIN</strong> - The Vehicle Identification Number can provide useful information that can help in determining the correct part.
			<li><strong>Pictures</strong> - We might need to see a comparison of the part received versus the original to determine the correct part.

	        <li>Jack the vehicle off the ground and secure it from rolling.
	        <li>Remove the wheel.
	        <li>Remove the axle nut (the large nut on the outside of the hub)
	        <li>Separate the lower ball joint from hub assembly. Then do the same for the tie rod end
	        <li>The hub will be able to swing out away allowing the outer CV joint to be slipped out through the back. This may require a tap on the threaded end of the outer CV joint. Put the axle nut back on half way so that you can tap on it without damaging the threads.
	        <li>The inner CV joint will be the only thing holding it axle in place. The inner CV joint is held in by a "c" clip, just pry it away from the differential and it will pop out, you may need to tap it from behind. Now you should be able to pull it out of the differential.

    <dt>Rebuilding a CV joint</dt>
    <dd>
		<ol>
	        <li>Once you have disassembled the CV joint from the axle shaft, place it in a vice with the splined end facing down.
	        <li>Degrease the old housing and then look for contact wear in the area where the ball moves back and forth in the grooves. Housing wear is normal and increases with mileage. Rebuilding should not be performed when the wear pattern becomes extreme.
	        <li>If you are reusing any part of the old race, cage, or ball bearings degrease them and also look for any wear, dimples, or pitting. You can check the cage for cracks by dropping the cage on a hard surface. It should make a pinging sound, if not look closely for a crack.
	        <li>To reassemble the CV joint, place the race back into the cage. Align the race spherical lands with the cage windows.
	        <li>Place the assembled cage and race back into the CV joint housing. For heavy duty units you want the thick side facing out
	        <li>Now place one ball into the cage window and tap lightly on the cage while holding the race to keep it from moving out of position to make contact with the ball.
	        <li>Once the ball is down into the track tap lightly on the cage and race toward the side of that ball to expose the next window and repeat the process until all of the balls are installed.
	        <li>Remove the clip from the axle shaft and place the shaft into the CV joint
	        <li>Rotate the axle shaft around (no more than a 30 angle) to check for the smoothness of operation in the CV joint.
	        <li>Twist the shaft from side to side to check for looseness. It may have a little play just nothing excessive.
	        <li>Remove the axle shaft.
	        <li>Cut the corner of the grease packet and make it like a bakers bag.
	        <li>Press the cut corner of the grease packet tightly into the hole were the axle shaft will go.
	        <li>Squeeze until you see grease come up around the balls then set the packet aside for the next procedure.
	        <li>Install the clip back on the axle shaft and place the boot for the CV joint onto the shaft. Slide the boot down to the other joint, so it is out of the way.
	        <li>Place the axle shaft back into the CV joint by lining up the splines of the shaft with the ones on the CV joint and press downward. You'll want to use a screwdriver to push the clip inward while pressing down to get it centered.
	        <li>Now give the shaft a light tap with a soft hammer and the shaft should slide in easily until you feel the clip catch. It's a good idea to try to pull the shaft out to make sure it securely seated correctly inside the CV joint.
	        <li>Take the remaining grease and make a bead around the top of the joint, similar to how an ice cream cone is shaped.
	        <li>Now slide the boot down and tighten the large clamp.
	        <li>Before you tighten the small clamp, put a screw driver in between the shaft and the boot to allow any trapped air to escape then remove it and install the small clamp.
	        <li>If replacing the other CV joint, repeat the above steps for it. Otherwise, the axle is ready to be put back into the vehicle.

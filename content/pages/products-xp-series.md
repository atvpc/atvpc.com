After years of design refinements and real-world testing, we are pleased to announce the release and availability of our 
*extreme performance* **MONSTER AXLES XP** Series.

The performance of our XP Series axles addresses all issues and demands of today's high-powered, highly modified monster 
mud machines. The long list of features makes them the number one choice of enthusiasts who want to take their stock 
vehicle to a much higher performance level. These include:

* **4340 Chromoly Steel CV Joints**: larger, stronger, and more durable than stock.
* **GEN II Technology**: ingenius design has additional machined grooved cut into the ball tracks and contact surfaces to allow for better lubrication flow. This increased lubricant flow <em>cools the joint</em> more efficiently and ensures more even distribution of lubricant throughout the joint giving both <em>better performance and longer life</em>.
* **40 Degree Angle of Operation**: our design is fixed to the shaft and gives up to a <em>40 degree angle of operation</em> thus preventing the bar from hitting the inner CV joint housing.
* **XP Telescopic Shafts**: XP shafts telescope, allowing for use on stock sizes up to a 4" lifted vehicle. The plunge mechanism of the shaft is a unique ball &amp; cage design allowing for a smooth range of travel without binding or catching like many splined shafts.
* **Puncture Resistant CV Boots**: puncture resistant material with a multi rib design allows for more flexibility and increased durability.

Built to Last
-------------
We've installed the Monster Axle XP Series on a 3 inch lifted Polaris RZR. The RZR has seen 1300+ trail miles for over 3 
years. At no point in time were the boots ever punctured or the axles removed for any reason. Simply put, our XP series 
is built to last.

Privacy Policy
==============
ATV Parts Connection is serious about protecting our customers' personal 
information. You can always browse our site without providing any personal 
information.

Your Personal Information Is Private
------------------------------------
While doing business with you, we may ask for certain information, such 
as your name, home address, vehicle, phone number, and email address. 
We will not sell, rent, trade or give away individual, personally 
identifiable information entered on this site to any third party. 
We collect such information so that we can process orders, personalize 
your shopping experience, and/or send you the latest product information 
and other useful material.  If you do not wish to receive further material 
from ATV Parts Connection, you can simply respond to our email or 
otherwise tell us that you do not want to receive future communications.

Cookies
-------
ATVPC.com, like most Web sites, uses a feature of your browser to set a 
"cookie" on your computer. We cannot tell your name or any personal 
information about you based solely on the cookie.  Unless you specifically 
tell us your name and other identifying information, we will never know 
who you are.  The cookie just tells us what functions you perform when 
you are on the site so that we can keep track of your transaction. A 
cookie also helps ATV Parts Connection note particular traffic patterns 
on the site so that we can improve what we offer.

Every browser allows you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies you 
will accept. Rejecting cookies, however, may sometimes interfere with 
your ability to use all the features and benefits of our site.

ATV Parts Connection uses third-party analytics technology through Google 
Analytics and the Piwik Open Analytics Platform to improve the usefulness 
of the site. That analytics technology measures and analyzes 
non-identifying, aggregate usage and volume statistical information from 
site visitors in order to administer the site. ATV Parts Connection also 
uses that information to improve the quality of our service and the site's 
performance, by providing more relevant content to you during your visit(s). 
Information gathered with this analytics technology may include, but is 
not limited to, the following: the activity of the site visitor's browser 
when the visitor is viewing the site; the site path of visitors; general 
information regarding the visitor's internet service provider and host, 
and the time visitors spend on the site. Please note that this is not 
personal information, only general summaries of our visitors' usage of 
the site.  When you interact with the site, we strive to make that 
experience easy, meaningful, and relevant.

Third Parties
-------------
On occasion, we provide non-personal, aggregate information about our 
users to third parties such as manufacturers and business partners. 
For example, we may inform a manufacturer about what other products our 
users buy.  This information will not identify any user personally. ATV 
Parts Connection strives to protect buyersâ€™ contact information and we 
will not use that information with third parties in any way other than 
to directly notify the buyer in the event of a safety-related recall.

Outside Links
-------------
ATV Parts Connection may offer links to other sites.  Any time you click 
on a link and are transported to another site, you should be aware that 
the other site may have a different privacy policy than ATV Parts 
Connection. We cannot control the policies of other sites.

Changes
-------
This privacy policy is subject to change at the sole discretion of ATV 
Parts Connection.  Should we modify it, we will post the changes in a 
revised policy statement.

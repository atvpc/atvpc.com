The shipping fee is determined by the carrier (UPS, FedEx, USPS) and is dependant on the shipping address and weight of the package. Unfortunately, we do not control the fee charged by the shipping carriers.

While we do carry some small parts, most of the parts such as complete CV axles are awkwardly shaped and therefore do not fit into flat rate packaging. Many of the parts weigh much more than an usual package. For instance, CV axles are almost entirely made out of steel and can weigh more than 10 pounds.</p>

Shipping fees also tend to double when special services such as overnight delivery are needed. It is not unusual for a package to have shipping fees over $100 when some of these services are requested.

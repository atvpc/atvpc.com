We strive to correctly ship every order. Unfortunately, rare circumstances do arise such as incorrectly shipped parts. In the event this occurs, make sure you have access to the following information before [contacting us](/?contact):
		
* **Sales Number**:<br> 
  The sales number will allow us to quickly pull up your order from our computer system. You can find it at the top right of your sales receipt
* **Year, Make, Model**:<br> 
  The fitment information will allow us to confirm what is the correct part for your vehicle. The model should include the engine size. For instance, 
  "Polaris Sportsman 500" might refer to 3 different vehicles which take different parts: the *Polaris Sportsman 500*, the *Polaris Sportsman 500 H.O.*, and the *Polaris Sportsman 500 X2*.
* **Packaging**:<br> 
  Most packaging we use have a part number on one of the ends that can be compared to the actual part ordered. 
* **VIN**:<br> 
  The [Vehicle Identification Number](/?howto-vin) can provide useful information that can help in determining the correct part.
* **Pictures**:<br>
  We might need to see a comparison of the part received versus the original to determine the correct part.

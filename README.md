# ATV Parts Connection Website

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atvpc/atvpc.com/master/content/themes/ca-webstore/img/logo.png" alt="ATV Parts Connection Logo" title="ATVPC" align="right">

Source code for the [atvpc.com](http://atvpc.com) website, which runs on a custom CMS called txtBuch.

txtBuch uses PHP and a flat-file database consisting of [serialized](http://php.net/manual/en/function.serialize.php) arrays disguised as a ".dat" file.

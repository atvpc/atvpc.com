txtßüch
=======

txtßüch (or just "txtBuch") is a simple PHP content management system. The 
name is pronounced as "textbook".

The database backend uses flat files that are nothing more than a 
[serialized](http://php.net/manual/en/function.serialize.php) array cunningly 
disguised as a ".dat" file.

Installation
